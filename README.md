## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Questions

To evaluate hotel performance and customer behavior, we analyze the following key aspects:

- Booking Trends: When are the peak and off-peak booking periods?
- Cancellation Analysis: What percentage of bookings are canceled, and what are the primary reasons?
- Customer Segmentation: How do different customer types (business vs. leisure travelers) influence booking patterns?
- Revenue Insights: How do factors such as length of stay and room types impact total revenue?
- Lead Time Impact: How does the time between booking and check-in correlate with cancellations?
- Market Segment Analysis: Which customer segments generate the highest revenue?

## Process of Data Analysis

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
   
- Addressed missing values in the dataset.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical representations where necessary.
- Removed duplicate and inconsistent records for accuracy.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Examined cancellation percentages across various customer segments.
- Analyzed the impact of booking lead times on cancellations.
- Assessed revenue contributions by different customer types and room categories.
- Identified seasonal trends in hotel bookings.

3. Visualization & Insights:

- Bar & Pie Charts: Booking and cancellation patterns.
- Line Charts: Seasonal trends in booking volumes.
- Heatmaps: Correlation between booking lead time, cancellations, and revenue.
- Customer Segmentation Plots: Classification of high-revenue and high-risk customers.

## Project Insights (Key Findings)

- Booking Trends:
   - Peak booking months: May to August.
   - Off-peak periods: December to February.
- Cancellation Insights:
   - 28.5% of total bookings are canceled, with a higher rate among short lead-time reservations.
   - Bookings through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) exhibit the highest cancellation rate (45.2%).
- Customer Segmentation:
   - Business travelers have a lower cancellation rate (15.8%) compared to leisure travelers (32.1%).
- Revenue Insights:
   - Customers staying for 4 or more nights contribute 60% of total revenue.
   - Suite and deluxe room bookings generate the highest revenue per customer.
- Lead Time Analysis:
   - Bookings made over 90 days in advance have a lower cancellation rate (12.4%).
   - Last-minute bookings (within a few days of check-in) experience a high cancellation rate (54.3%).
- Market Segment Comparison:
   - Direct bookings yield higher revenue per customer but are less frequent than OTA bookings.

## Conclusion & Strategic Recommendations

- Mitigate Last-Minute Cancellations:
   - Implement structured cancellation policies with penalties or flexible rescheduling options.
- Promote Direct Bookings:
   - Introduce loyalty programs and exclusive discounts to encourage customers to book directly instead of using OTAs.
- Optimize Seasonal Pricing:
   - Increase rates during peak months to maximize revenue.
   - Offer discounts during off-peak periods to maintain occupancy levels.
- Enhance Room Allocation Strategies:
   - Prioritize premium room assignments for long-stay customers to optimize revenue per booking.
- Encourage Early Bookings:
   - Offer incentives such as discounts or complimentary services for customers who book well in advance to reduce last-minute cancellations.
     
By implementing these strategies, hotels can improve occupancy rates, increase revenue, and enhance overall customer satisfaction, leading to long-term business success.
